Middleware:
  A middle-man for your system to handle requests and responses
  Treat middleware as a few extra steps to get the work you required done.

  With routes, the routes you define are considered middleware as well, but are almost always the LAST step in the chain.

The order for middleware is as follows:
  Your applications run middleware from top to bottom
  Each piece of middleware runs and then tells the next one to run
