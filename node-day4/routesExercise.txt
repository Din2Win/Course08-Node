Instructions for each link:
  Identify the full route
  Identify any slugs(Use your best judgment when naming them, we can't tell what they actually are but we should provide a meaningful name to them)
  Identify the query if it exists
  Convert the slugs to a params object by hand
  Convert the query to a query object by hand
  Recreate the route in Express(use the routesApp.js), and have the route return the slugs/query objects as JSON
