/*
  NPM - Node Package Manager
    Bundled with Node - See video on Node creator's thoughts on it now.

    Common Commands(start with npm first):
      init - Stands for initialize: start a new project using NPM, include -y
      install - Install a package(you can shorten to i) OR re-install all dependencies for a package that has lost its node_modules. You can install as many packages at a time as you please.

    package.json:
      - Keeps track of high level information about your project.
      - Also used for keeping track of all library/package dependencies required for your project to run.
      - As well as common scripts you will use with your application
      
    package-lock.json
      - keeps track of the version of the code you installed the first time you installed it.
      - This is to ensure that when packages are updated it does not unintentionally break your code
